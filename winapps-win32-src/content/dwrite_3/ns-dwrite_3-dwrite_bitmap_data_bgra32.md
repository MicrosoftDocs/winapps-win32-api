## -description

Represents bitmap data in BGRA32 format.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DWriteCore implementation of [DirectWrite](/windows/win32/directwrite/direct-write-portal). For more info, and code examples, see [DWriteCore overview](/windows/win32/directwrite/dwritecore-overview).

## -struct-fields

### -field width

Type: **[UINT32](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

The width, in pixels, of the bitmap.

### -field height

Type: **[UINT32](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

The height, in pixels, of the bitmap.

### -field pixels

Type: \_Field\_size\_(width * height) **[UINT32](/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)\***

A pointer to the location of the bit values for the bitmap.

## Examples
