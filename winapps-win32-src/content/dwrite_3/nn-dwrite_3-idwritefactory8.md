## -description

This interface represents a factory object from which all DirectWrite objects are created. **IDWriteFactory8** adds a new version of [TranslateColorGlyphRun](./nf-dwrite_3-idwritefactory8-translatecolorglyphrun.md), which takes a **DWRITE_PAINT_FEATURE_LEVEL**.

The **IDWriteFactory8** interface inherits from the [IDWriteFactory7](./nn-dwrite_3-idwritefactory7.md) interface.
