## -description

Creates a factory object that is used for subsequent creation of individual DWriteCore objects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API is available as part of the DWriteCore implementation of [DirectWrite](/windows/win32/directwrite/direct-write-portal). For more info, and code examples, see [DWriteCore overview](/windows/win32/directwrite/dwritecore-overview).

## -parameters

### -param factoryType

Type: <b><a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/ne-dwrite-dwrite_factory_type">DWRITE_FACTORY_TYPE</a></b>

A value that specifies whether the factory object will be shared, isolated, or restricted.

### -param iid

Type: <b>REFIID</b>

A GUID value that identifies the DirectWrite factory interface, such as __uuidof([IDWriteFactory](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefactory)).

### -param factory

Type: <b>IUnknown**</b>

An address of a pointer to the newly created DirectWrite factory object.

## -returns

Type: <b>HRESULT</b>

If this method succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. Otherwise, it returns an **HRESULT** error code.

## Examples

See the [DWriteCore overview](/windows/win32/directwrite/dwritecore-overview) topic, and the [DWriteCoreGallery](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK-Samples/tree/main/Samples/TextRendering/cpp-win32/DWriteCoreGallery) sample app.

## -remarks

This is functionally the same as the [DWriteCreateFactory](/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nf-dwrite-dwritecreatefactory) function exported by the system version of DirectWrite. The DWriteCore function has a different name to avoid ambiguity.
